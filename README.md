## 📝 Project Overview

AudioJailbreak provides a comprehensive evaluation framework for testing the robustness of audio language models against adversarial attacks. Our method incorporates carefully designed perturbations in audio inputs to test model security mechanisms. Key features include:

- **Diverse test cases**: Covering multiple categories of harmful speech samples
- **Automated evaluation pipeline**: End-to-end automation from audio processing to result analysis
- **Bayesian optimization**: Intelligent search for optimal perturbation parameters
- **Multi-model compatibility**: Support for evaluating mainstream audio language models

## 💾 Dataset

**Important Notice**: This repository contains code only. All audio data and preprocessed/inference result JSONL files are hosted on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/NEUQ-LIS-LAB/AudioJailbreak).

Dataset includes:
- Original speech samples (`audio/`)
- Input JSONL files (`convert/question`)
- Model responses (`inference/response`)
- Evaluation results (`eval/xx`), where xx is model name
- Original texts (`text/`)

### Core Components

- **new_add_noise.py**: Implements multiple audio perturbation methods
- **APT_BO_diva.py**: Bayesian optimization-based adversarial sample generation
- **xx.py**: Model inference interfaces (xx represents model name)
- **eval.py**: Evaluation metric calculations

## 🚀 Usage

### 1. Data Preparation

```
Link: https://huggingface.co/datasets/NEUQ-LIS-LAB/AudioJailbreak
```

### 2. Basic Audio Jailbreaking

```bash
# Generate adversarial samples with Bayesian optimization
python infer/xx.py  # Replace xx with model name
```

### 3. APT-based Bayesian Audio Jailbreaking

```bash
# Generate adversarial samples with Bayesian optimization
python infer/APT_BO_diva.py
```

### 4. Model Evaluation

```bash
# Single model evaluation
python eval_utils/eval.py

# Batch evaluation
bash eval_utils/auto.sh
```

### 5. Result Analysis

```bash
# Generate evaluation report
python eval/all_average.py
```

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

Our benchmark uses multiple metrics to assess model security:

- **dict_dsr**: Model refusal rate (dict_dsr=1-asr)
- **Semantic Similarity**: Semantic similarity of refusal responses
- **GPT Score**: Includes sub-metrics:
  - Harmfulness: Degree of harmful content
  - Policy Violation: Policy violation rate
  - Relevance: Response relevance
